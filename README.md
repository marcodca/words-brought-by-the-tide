## Acknowledgments

This project was made with React, bootstrapped with Create React App using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template. There's some serverless interaction for the global counter, provided by FaunaDB. Styled-components were used for styling, and animation handled by framer-motion (a great experience animating svg with this library). Testing by Jest and React-testing-library.
